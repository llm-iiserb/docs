**7.1 Teaching** 

  Medium of Instruction : Medium of instruction is English.  Approval of Courses : The Senate approves each course along with credits allotted for that course. Only approved courses will be offered in a given semester.  List of Courses : The list of courses offered by a Department is finalized before the pre-registration of each semester by the concerned Head of that Department in consultation with the DUGC. In general, during every semester, no two courses, within or across Departments with overlapping contents (>50%) will be offered. The list of courses to be offered should be submitted to the Office of Academic Affairs two weeks before preregistration.  Course credits: Credit of a course is decided by the Academic Load which is the amount of time student is expected to spend while learning that course.

- SS hours are calculated as follows: 

- SS = 1.5 * L + 1/3 * Lab (for 1st^ and 2nd     year BS-MS courses) 

- SS = 2.5 * L + 1/3 * Lab (for professional     courses)  Credits are calculated using academic load, as follows: 

- Credits = Round off (AL/3) (for courses     with lecture and/or lab component) 

- Credits = Round off (AL/2.5) (for all     other courses, e.g., thesis, seminar,     reading courses) 

 **Conduct of Courses and Examination** : Each course is conducted by the instructor-in-charge with assistance from other instructors and/or tutors, as applicable. The instructor should provide the solution set for the mid and end semester examinations of core and pre-major courses (100 and 200 level courses) to the students within a maximum of 4 hours of the completion of the examination. The solution set should be displayed on the LHC notice board or sent via email, under intimation to Office of Academic Affairs. The instructor should make it possible for the student to see the graded answer scripts of mid-semester examination and end-semester examination by the 


 last date of the mid/end-semester examination or before assigning the grades.  Auditing of Courses : A student can audit any course in addition to the prescribed academic load with prior permission from the concerned instructor-in-charge. Under this arrangement, the student is simply auditing the course and no grade will be awarded for the same. 

**7.2 Guidelines for the conduct of examinations** 

 In the week prior to commencement of the endsemester examination, quizzes and assignment should not be conducted. However, all lectures and laboratories will be conducted as per schedule. Also, laboratory end-semester examination may be conducted during this period. a. Scheduling of Examinations: Mid-semester and end-semester examinations timetable will be prepared by the Office of Academic Affairs and circulated to all faculty members and students at least 10 days prior to the start of the examination. The schedule for examination of core and premajor courses must be strictly followed. Also, all examinations (core, pre-major and professional courses) must be conducted only during the approved examination period. The scheduling of examination of courses offered through the NKN will be decided by the host Institution and the students will be informed by the Office of Academic Affairs/local instructor as soon as the information is received. 


**b. Make-up Examinations** : If a student misses the end-semester examination due to genuine reasons, in one or more course(s), he/she can make a request, personally or by nominating a suitable person, to the Instructor under intimation to DoAA for a make-up examination within a day of missing the scheduled examination. Such a request must be made in writing and submitted to the concerned instructor with a copy to the Office of Academic Affairs. If a student is medically unfit, he/she must substantiate it with a certificate from the authorised doctor at the Health Center of the Institute. Only one make-up examination in lieu of endsemester examination is allowed per course. In case of missing a mid-semester examination, it is totally up to the instructor as to how he/she decides to evaluate the student provided that he/she is satisfied with the reasons given by the student. The instructor can conduct a make-up mid-semester examination or can choose to prorate the student’s performance based on quizzes/assignments/endsemester examination.

**7.3 Evaluation/Assessment** 

 The assessment of students in a course is a continuous process. It is based on their performance in the midsemester examination, end-semester examination, quizzes, assignments, attendance, and make up examination (if any). 


**Weightage for various evaluation components** 

a. For the written component, the weightage is as follows: 

 Course Type 

 Minimum weightage for written components 

 Maximum weightage for other components (quizzes/assi 

 gnments/ 

 term paper/seminar 

 etc.) 

 Mid Semester 

 End Semester Core 30% 50% 20% 

 Professional 20% 30% 30% 

 For professional courses, no more than 10% weightage will be given to oral examination and attendance. The weightage for various components and the grading policy (absolute or relative) will be made clear to the students at the beginning of the semester. 

b. If laboratory work is a part of the course, it will be weighted appropriately depending on total credits for the course. For example, in a given course of four credits, if the credits for theory and laboratory parts in the course are in the ratio of 3:1, the final grades for the course will be assigned such that the weightage for the theory and the laboratory part remains 3:1. 

c. Instructor must retain the answer sheets for a minimum of one year before destroying them. 


**7.4 Grading** 

 (i) Submission of Grades : Prior to assigning a final letter grade, the instructor-in-charge of each course must show the answer sheets to the students. The letter grades given by the instructors must reflect the progress of the student based on his/her performance in the mid-semester examination, end-semester examination, quizzes, assignments and regular attendance in the classes. Final grades must be entered online and a signed hardcopy must be submitted to the Office of Academic Affairs within the prescribed time limit as given below: Number of students Prescribed time-limit Less than 25 48 hours 26 to 50 72 hours 51 to 150 96 hours 151 to 200 120 hours More than 200 144 hours (ii) Grades: There are six letter grades: O, A, B, C, D and F. The letter grades, their descriptions, and their numerical equivalents on a scale of 10-points (called grade point) are as follows: Grade Weight (grade point) 

 Description 

 O 10 Outstanding A 10 Excellent B 8 Good C 6 Fair D 4 Pass F 0 Fail 


 ‘O’ grade is intended to recognize and encourage outstanding performance in a class. This grade is to be used sparingly. In addition, there is an ‘I’ grade which stands for Incomplete. Besides, these grades, there are two other grades ‘S’ and ‘X’. ‘S’ stands for Satisfactory and ‘X’ for Unsatisfactory. 

**(iii) Incomplete Grade** : An ‘I’ (Incomplete) grade in any course may be awarded to a student who has missed the end-semester examination because of some genuine reason, but otherwise has completed all other requirements satisfactorily. An ‘I’ grade in a course should not be given to a student because he/she has failed in it. An ‘I’ grade must, however, be converted into a proper letter grade by the instructor-in-charge and should be communicated to the Office of Academic Affairs by the last date for submission of grades for make-up examination, as specified in the academic calendar. If the instructor-in-charge does not intimate the Office of Academic Affairs on time, all the ‘I’ grades awarded will be automatically converted to ‘F’. 

**(iv) Satisfactory and Unsatisfactory Grades** : Grades ‘S’ and ‘X’ do not carry any numerical weight, and are not used for the computation of SPI/CPI. Grade ‘S’ implies that the student has earned the credits. Grade ‘X’ implies that the student has failed in the course and thereby does not earn any credit. 

**(v) MS Thesis Grade** : The fifth year of BS-MS Programme is mostly devoted to MS Thesis. Some departments can have courses along with the thesis work during this period. Each student will be allotted 


a faculty member to supervise his/her thesis work. Additionally, for faculty members on probation, a cosupervisor must also be allotted. If the thesis supervisor is away, a co-supervisor/administrative supervisor may be assigned to the student. The progress of the thesis work will be evaluated on the basis of (a) thesis work carried out by the student, (b) a presentation of the thesis work by the student to the entire Department. The first component will be evaluated by a three-member committee (proposed by the thesis supervisor of the student) and approved by the DUGC, in each semester. This committee will award marks out of 70. A three-member committee appointed by the Head of the Department will assess the second component and marks will be awarded out of 30. The assessment is based on the thesis, oral presentations during the semesters and defense of the work done in the thesis. A letter grade (O-F) will be assigned based on the total marks obtained in components (a) and (b). 

MS Thesis grades shall be given by the last date specified for submission of the grades in each of Semester 9 and 10. An ‘I’ grade shall not be awarded for non-completion of the thesis except due to illness. An ‘I’ grade cannot be awarded for non-completion of the thesis due to lack of facilities. 

**Ph.D. thesis work grades** : A student earns four credits for each Ph.D. thesis unit he/she has registered. Thesis supervisor will monitor the progress towards thesis credits during every semester and assign the student a letter grade of ‘S’ or ‘X’. For e.g. a student registered for 16 research credits in a semester may be awarded any one of the following 


 grade combinations: SSSS, SSSX, SSXX, SXXX or XXXX. If a student is on leave for part of a semester or submits his/her thesis in the middle of the semester, the DoAA may reduce his/her research credits. 

**(vi) Change of Grade already awarded** : A letter grade once awarded shall not be changed, unless a request is made by the course instructor-in-charge and is approved by the Chairperson Senate. Any request for change of grade must be made within six weeks of the start of the next semester with all the relevant records and justifications. 

**(vii) Semester Performance Index (SPI):** The Semester Performance Index (SPI) is a weighted average of the grade points earned by a student in all courses credited and describes his/her academic performance in a semester. SPI is calculated as follows: 

 SPI = ∑ 

### 𝑛𝑖=1𝑐𝑖𝑔𝑖 

### ∑ 𝑛𝑖=1𝑐𝑖 

 where ci = credit for the ith^ course; gi= grade point secured by the student. Summation is over all ‘n’ courses credited by the student in that semester. 

**(viii) Cumulative Performance Index (CPI)** : The Cumulative Performance Index (CPI) indicates the overall academic performance of a student in all courses registered up to and including the latest completed semester. CPI is calculated as follows: 

 CPI = ∑ 

### 𝑛𝑖=1𝑐𝑖𝑔𝑖 

### ∑ 𝑛𝑖=1𝑐𝑖 

 Summation is over all the ‘n’ courses credited by the student in all the completed semesters. Whenever a 


 student is permitted to appear for re-examination in a course, then the new letter grade replaces the old letter grade in the computation of CPI. (ix) Grade Report : The grade report, with details of courses registered and grades obtained, SPI for each semester and the CPI based on the grades of all courses taken up to and including the semester, will be available to the student on Shiksha portal once the result for that semester are declared officially. At the end of the programme a transcript will be provided. (x) Withholding of Grades: The grades of a student can be withheld if he/she has not paid the dues or if there is a case of indiscipline pending against him/her or for any other reason. 

**7.5 Re-examination** 

 Re-examination will be conducted for all courses in which students have earned an ‘F’ grade. A new code ‘RE’ will be introduced in the grade report to indicate that the student has appeared for a re-examination. For the purpose of CPI calculation, re-examination will be treated similar to repeating a course. a. Re-examination schedule Re-examination registration window will open for ten days starting from the first working day of June every year. Re-examination will be scheduled during the first week of July Students will not be allowed to register for more than 6 courses during the re-examination. Such students will have to pay the prescribed examination fee. The student should pay the fee 


 online and submit online fee receipt along with reexamination form to the Office of Academic Affairs. b. Grading policy If a student registers and appears for reexamination within a period of one year of failing the course, the grades for such students will be assigned as per the grading policy for the original class. All quizzes, mid-semester, assignment and other component scores earned during the regular semester will be retained and only the end-semester score obtained in the re-examination will replace the original end-semester score to award the grade. For students appearing in re-examination after one year, only the re-examination scores will be used to award the final grade and such a grade will be capped at a maximum of ‘C’. 

**7.6 Inadequate Academic Performance** 

 The academic performance of each student is reviewed at the end of each semester based on the credits and SPI/CPI earned by him/her at the end of that semester. Warning and Academic Probation: A student will be placed under warning/academic probation in view of academic deficiency. Programme Name 

 Warning Academic Probation BS CPI < 6.0 SPI < 4.0 

### CPI < 5.0 

### BS-MS CPI < 6.0
