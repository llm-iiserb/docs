Every student needs to fulfill all academic criteria set by IISER Bhopal at each stage of the Ph.D. Program for continuation of the fellowship. 

**Admission Procedure** 

Prospective students must apply for admission following advertisements along with the required documents, to the DoAA. 


Applicants will be selected for admission to the Ph.D. programme by the concerned Departmental Selection Committee, comprising of faculty members of the Department, duly constituted by the Head of the Department. The Chairperson, Senate/DoAA will approve the admission. 

Selection of applicants for admission to the Ph.D. programme will be based on a written test and/or oral interview of the short-listed candidates. SC/ST candidates will be interviewed first and will not be compared with general category candidates. 

Selected candidates, who have fulfilled all the requirements for admission, but cannot produce a proof of having passed and securing the minimum specified qualifying marks, or proof of clearing the qualifying examination, may be considered for provisional admission. However, such students will have to produce the required documents by the last date for document submission in the academic calendar (generally 8 weeks from the date of registration), failing which their provisional admission will be cancelled.

Further, the Institute has the right to cancel the admission of any student and ask him/her to leave the Institute at any stage of his/her career on grounds of unsatisfactory academic performance, irregular attendance in classes, or indiscipline. 


 On approval, the Office of Academic Affairs will issue admission offer letters to the selected students. The selected students will be required to accept the offer of admission by depositing the prescribed fee before the specified date. In case a student does not accept the offer by paying the prescribed fee by the specified date, his/her admission stands cancelled and admission offer may be made to students in the waitlist, if any, in order of merit. The offer of admission may also stand withdrawn if a student who has accepted the offer fails to register by the date of late registration. 

**11. CURRICULUM FOR Ph.D. PROGRAMME** 

 Ph.D. programme consists of courses and research work. The aim of the course work is to strengthen the fundamental understanding in the subject and to prepare them for conducting research work. 

**11.1 Academic Load** 

 A semester load is defined as equivalent to 16 credits. It could be either course work, or research work or a combination of course work and research work. One research workload carries 4 credits. Most courses carry 4 credits, while a few courses may carry less or more credits. Thus, a student who has registered for a full semester load solely by course work is expected to attend 4 such four-credit courses. A student registered for a full semester load solely by research work is expected to register for 4 units of research work. Under 


 exceptional circumstances, the Senate may permit a student to register for a maximum of 20 credits or minimum of 12 credits. After fulfilment of a total minimum credit requirement of 96 credits, a Ph.D. student may be allowed to register for a minimum of 4 credits per semester until the completion of the program (subject to a maximum of 7 years from the date of admission into Ph.D.) to be considered as a full time student. 

**11.2 Inadequate Academic Performance** 

 The academic performance of each student is reviewed at the end of each semester based on the credits and SPI/CPI earned by him/her at the end of that semester. Warning A warning will be issued to a Ph.D. student if he/she earns 2 or more ‘X’ grades in a semester. Termination A student may be terminated from the Ph.D. programme under the following circumstances: 

1. CPI is below 7.0. 

2. Has earned two ‘F’ grades in the same or different     courses. 

3. Has earned 8 ‘X’ grades in research work. 

4. Has earned 6 or more ‘X’ grades in research work     in two consecutive semesters.

However, such work must be carried out under the guidance of IISER Bhopal faculty and his/her thesis supervisor will evaluate the progress of this work. Prior to undertaking work outside IISER Bhopal, the student must obtain consent from the DPGC and approval from DoAA. 

**12.3 Provisions for Relaxation** 

 Senate may grant relaxation in the prescribed minimum/maximum residence and/or academic requirements to a student in view of the work done by him/her in the Institute or elsewhere, to the extent 


 considered appropriate according to the merit of the case. 

**12.4 Assignment of Thesis Supervisor** 

 A Ph.D. research supervisor will be assigned to every student at an appropriate time in the programme, as decided by individual Departments. The following guidelines will be followed in assigning research supervisor(s): 

1. A student shall not normally have more than two     supervisors at any given time. The primary     supervisor must be from the parent department of     the student. 

2. Thesis supervisor of a student will normally be     appointed from amongst the faculty members at     IISER Bhopal in accordance with the guidelines of     each Department. In general, supervisor(s) can be     chosen any time before completing the course     work. Criteria used for assigning thesis     supervisor(s) include students’ preference for a     research area, his/her performance in the interview,     and performance in course work at IISER Bhopal. 

3. Under special circumstances the Senate may allow     a scientist/faculty member from another academic     Institution to be a co-supervisor. 

4. The assignment or change of supervisor(s) of a     student must be intimated to the Office of     Academic Affairs. Addition or change of     supervisor is not allowed once the thesis is     submitted. In case a supervisor of a Ph.D. student is 


 change/added, the student cannot submit his/her thesis until after six months of the change. 

5. If the thesis supervisor is a faculty member on     probation (at assistant professor or new joinee at     associate professor and professor level), the DPGC     will appoint a co-supervisor, who is a confirmed     faculty member. Once the services of the primary     supervisor are confirmed by the Institute, the co-     supervisor will be relieved. 

**12.5 Assignment of Alternate Thesis Supervisor** 

 For Ph.D. students who are assigned to only one supervisor the criteria for assigning alternate supervisors under specific circumstances are as follows: 

1. If the supervisor of the Ph.D. student is away on     long leave, the DPGC will appoint a new     supervisor or a co-supervisor, in consultation with     the supervisor of the Ph.D. student. In case, the     supervisor of a Ph.D. student goes on short leave,     the DPGC will appoint an administrative     supervisor to fulfil various formalities. 

2. In the event that a thesis supervisor proposes to go     on leave when a Ph.D. student has completed all     research work and is only writing his/her thesis, the     DPGC may appoint an administrative supervisor.     This supervisor will take care of all formalities like     submission of thesis, suggesting a list of examiners     and conducting the oral examinations. 

3. If the thesis supervisor of a Ph.D. student retires,     resigns, or otherwise ceases to be a faculty member 


 of the Institute, the DPGC will appoint a new supervisor or co-supervisor. 

**12.6 Comprehensive Examination** 

1. All students must pass a comprehensive     examination designed to test the overall     comprehension of the student in the various     subjects. A student can appear in the     comprehensive examination only after he/she has     completed the course requirements and satisfied     the minimum specified CPI requirement. The total     number of credits to be obtained in order to appear     for the comprehensive examination is 32 (The     reminder of 16 credits coming from research     credits). Additional course credit may be imposed     by department to suit their requirements. 

2. Students admitted to the Ph.D. programme should     complete their course requirements along with the     comprehensive examination within a period of     four registered semesters from the date of     admission to the programme. 

3. The comprehensive examination will be either oral     or written, or a combination of both as detailed in     the guidelines of individual Departments, duly     approved by the Senate. 

4. The Comprehensive Examination Board will     consist of at least three but not more than five     faculty members of the student's Department and     one faculty member from outside the Department.     Constitution of the board will be proposed by the     thesis supervisor (DPGC, if supervisor is not yet     assigned) and will be forwarded by the DPGC for 


 the approval of the DoAA. The thesis supervisor of the student, if already assigned, will be the convener of the board else convener, DPGC will be the convener of the board. 

5. Although no grades are assigned for the     comprehensive examination, students are required     to pass the same. A student will be considered to     have passed the comprehensive examination if all     except at the most one member of the board are     satisfied with student's performance in the     examination. The report of the comprehensive     examination must be sent to the DoAA within 8     weeks of the date of approval of the board. 

6. When a student has not passed the comprehensive     examination in his/her first attempt, a second     comprehensive examination will be conducted by     the same board that was constituted earlier unless     otherwise approved by the Chairperson, Senate on     the recommendation of the DPGC and the DoAA.     A student will not be allowed to appear in the     comprehensive examination more than twice. A     student not qualifying the comprehensive exam in     two attempts or within four registered semesters     will be terminated from the programme. 

**12.7 Candidacy for the Ph.D. Degree** 

 A student enrolled in the Ph.D. programme is formally admitted to the candidacy for the Ph.D. degree after he/she has completed the course requirements for the degree with at least the minimum required CPI, and has passed the comprehensive examination. Only such 


 students who are admitted to the candidacy will be allowed to submit Ph.D. thesis. 

**12.8 Graduate Seminars** 

 (i) First Graduate Seminar: The candidate must give graduate seminar within one year of the comprehensive examination. This seminar must encompass the formulation of the research problem and survey of existing literature. If the student fails to clear graduate seminar in one attempt he/she must clear the same during subsequent attempts. (ii) Second Graduate Seminar: The student must give second graduate seminar by the end of eighth semester (for Ph.D.) and eleventh semester (for Integrated Ph.D.) of study. This seminar topic may be related to the research work of the student. Both the seminars will be assessed by a Department Level Committee and will be judged as satisfactory or unsatisfactory. In the latter case, a suitable course of action will be suggested by the Committee. The reports of the graduate seminars must be submitted to the DoAA through the thesis supervisor and Convener DPGC. 

**12.9 Open Seminar** 

 Prior to submitting his/her Ph.D. thesis, a student must present a seminar on his/her thesis work to an audience consisting of faculty members and students of the Institute. A notice of the open seminar must be displayed 7 days in advance. A copy of the notice should be submitted to the Office of Academic Affairs. 


 General Public is also permitted to attend the Open Seminar. The student may incorporate comments/ criticism obtained from the audience in his/her thesis. The thesis can be submitted only after satisfactorily presenting the Open Seminar. A satisfactory completion report has to be submitted to the DoAA through the thesis supervisor and Convener DPGC. The maximum time duration for the submission of the thesis after the delivery of the open seminar will be six months. In exceptional circumstances, the students may seek an extension of up to three months with proper justification. However, if the thesis is not submitted within the desired period including the extension, the open seminar already delivered will stand cancelled and the student will be required to give a fresh open seminar before he/she submits his/her thesis. 

**12.10 Ph.D. Thesis Evaluation Board** 

 The thesis will be evaluated by a board. The board, approved by the Chairperson, Senate, shall consist of two members in addition to the thesis supervisor(s). Members of the board should be very well recognized in the field and should be from other Institutes/ Universities/Research Organizations. The procedure for constitution of the ‘Thesis Evaluation Board’ is as follows: 

1. The list of thesis examiners should be proposed at     most 4 weeks before the submission of the Ph.D.     thesis. 


2. The research supervisor of the student should     propose a list of 10 examiners (including     himself/herself, with contact details including     email, fax, telephone number and complete postal     address) to the Office of Academic Affairs. Among     the 10 listed examiners for Ph.D. thesis evaluation,     not more than five may be from outside India. A     hardcopy and softcopy of the synopsis should also     be submitted along with the list of examiners.     To provide larger visibility to the research work     carried out in IISER Bhopal in international front it     is advised to put at least three examiners for Ph.D.     Thesis evaluation from outside India. 

3. The Chairperson, Senate, in consultation with the     DoAA will select the names of the thesis examiners     from the list provided by the supervisor to     constitute the thesis evaluation board. The     Chairperson, Senate may add examiners and/or ask     for an additional list of examiners, if required. In     case the Chairperson, Senate is the thesis     supervisor, then the thesis evaluation board will be     constituted by the DoAA. In case the DoAA is the     thesis supervisor, then the Chairperson, Senate will     constitute the thesis evaluation board, in     consultation with the Dean, Faculty Affairs. 

4. DoAA will send a copy of the synopsis to each     member of the thesis evaluation board for obtaining     their consent to act as thesis examiners. If no     consent is obtained within two weeks, DoAA will     communicate with other examiners in the list (as     approved by the Chairperson, Senate), and this     exercise will continue until adequate number of 


 examiners have consented. In rare circumstances, the DoAA may request another list of suggested examiners from the thesis supervisor, in case the original list is exhausted, and adequate number of examiners is not found. 

5. After consent is obtained from the examiners, a     copy of the thesis (soft bound hardcopy/softcopy     depending upon the preference of the examiner) is     sent to each examiner. Such a copy of the thesis     must be submitted to the Office of Academic     Affairs within 4 weeks of the submission of the list     of examiners. The preference of the thesis examiner     for a soft-bound copy/soft copy of the thesis will be     communicated to the supervisor as soon as it is     known. 

6. In case the DoAA is the supervisor of the Ph.D.     student, the above exercise is carried out by Dean,     Faculty Affairs. 

7. In all cases, the names of the thesis examiners will     be kept confidential till the oral examination. Upon     the completion of the evaluation of the Ph.D. thesis,     the Office of Academic Affairs will communicate     the names of the faculty members of the Institute (if     any), as well as, the names of the thesis examiners     from outside the Institute who will be a part of the     oral board, approved by the Chairperson, Senate, to     the thesis supervisor. 

**12.11 Ph.D. Thesis Evaluation** 

1. Upon receiving all reports from the thesis     evaluation board, the DoAA will place the thesis in 


 one of the following categories in accordance with the nature of recommendations: i. Category 1: The examiner has not pointed out any errors and has no corrections/suggestions. The examiner has recommended that the thesis be accepted as is. ii. Category 2: The examiner has pointed out only grammatical errors like punctuation, spelling mistakes or language problems. Suggested changes must be incorporated in the thesis to the satisfaction of the oral board. 

iii. **Category 3:** The examiner points out minor technical mistakes/raises queries/suggests some modifications but does not subject the acceptance of the thesis to the answering of queries/incorporation of suggestions. The student must respond to the queries raised by the examiner and submit the revised thesis to the Office of Academic Affairs through his/her thesis supervisor. Suggested changes must be incorporated in the thesis to the satisfaction of the oral board. iv. **Category 4:** The thesis examiners reject the thesis in its present form and point out major technical errors, clearly mentioning that the thesis cannot be accepted unless he/she is satisfied with the changes made by the student. In this case, the thesis supervisor(s) will communicate the changes carried out in the thesis, if any, in response to the queries raised by the examiner(s) with a covering note and 


 send it to the examiner through the DoAA with a request to respond within six weeks. If no response is received within the stipulated period, a reminder will be sent and the wait period will be extended by another six weeks. If no response is received even after twelve weeks further action will be initiated. v. Category 5: The thesis examiners find the thesis unsuitable and reject it. The thesis examiners explicitly mention that this thesis cannot be considered even with major revisions/resubmissions. If one of the examiners rejects the thesis, the matter will be referred to Chairperson, Senate for deciding further course of action. If two or more examiners reject the thesis, the thesis will be rejected. Students receiving such a recommendation will be terminated from their academic programme. 

2. Copies of the report along with the category of the     thesis (without the identity of the examiner) will be     communicated to the thesis supervisor(s). 

3. On completion of the process detailed above, the     DoAA will intimate the concurrence of the     Chairperson, Senate, if given, to the supervisor, to     initiate the constitution of the oral board. This     concurrence of Chairperson, Senate will be given if     all the examiners recommend acceptance of the     thesis. 

4. In case the DoAA is the supervisor of the student     concerned, the above processing will be done by     Dean, Faculty Affairs. 


 If plagiarism is detected at any stage during the Ph.D. programme or even after award of the degree, disciplinary action including termination from the programme or withdrawal of the degree, as appropriate, will be initiated by the Institute. 

**12.12 Submission of Evaluated Thesis** 

 Hard bound copies of the Ph.D. thesis can be submitted only after the corrections, if any required by the thesis evaluation board have been incorporated.
