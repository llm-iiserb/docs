7. **TEACHING<a name="_page25_x48.00_y150.00"></a> AND EVALUATION** 
1. **Teaching<a name="_page25_x48.00_y171.00"></a>** 
- **Medium of Instruction**: Medium of instruction is English. 
- **Approval of Courses**: The Senate approves each course along with credits allotted for that course. Only approved courses will be offered in a given semester. 
- **List of Courses**: The list of courses offered by a Department is finalized before the pre-registration of  each  semester  by  the  concerned  Head  of  that Department  in  consultation  with  the  DUGC.  In general,  during  every  semester,  no  two  courses, within  or  across  Departments  with  overlapping contents (>50%) will be offered. The list of courses to be offered should be submitted to the Office of Academic  Affairs  two  weeks  before  pre- registration. 
- **Course credits:** Credit of a course is decided by the Academic Load which is the amount of time student  is  expected  to  spend  while  learning  that course.** 

**22| 

Academic Load, AL is defined as follows: 

- AL = Lecture (L) + Tutorial (T) + Self Study (SS) + Lab (Lab) + Discussion/Seminar (D) 
- Self-Study  (SS)  includes  assignments, reports/term papers. Instructors should ensure that the workload is commensurate with the SS hours allotted. 
  - SS hours are calculated as follows: 
  - SS = 1.5 \* L + 1/3 \* Lab (for 1st and 2nd year BS-MS courses) 
  - SS = 2.5 \* L + 1/3 \* Lab (for professional courses) 
- Credits are calculated using academic load, as follows: 
- Credits = Round off (AL/3) (for courses with lecture and/or lab component) 
- Credits  =  Round  off  (AL/2.5)  (for  all other  courses,  e.g.,  thesis,  seminar, reading courses) 
- **Conduct  of  Courses  and  Examination**:  Each course is conducted by the instructor-in-charge with assistance from other instructors and/or tutors, as applicable.  The  instructor  should  provide  the solution  set  for  the  mid  and  end  semester examinations  of core and pre-major  courses (100 and  200  level  courses)  to  the  students  within  a maximum  of  4  hours  of  the  completion  of  the examination. The solution set should be displayed on the LHC notice board or sent via email, under intimation  to  Office  of  Academic  Affairs.  The instructor should make it possible for the student to see  the  graded  answer  scripts  of  mid-semester examination and end-semester examination by the 

**23| 

last  date  of  the  mid/end-semester  examination  or before assigning the grades.

- **Auditing  of  Courses**:  A  student  can  audit  any course in addition to the prescribed academic load with  prior  permission  from  the  concerned instructor-in-charge.  Under  this  arrangement,  the student is simply auditing the course and no grade will be awarded for the same. 
2. **Guidelines<a name="_page27_x48.00_y175.00"></a> for the conduct of examinations** 

   In  the  week  prior  to  commencement  of  the  end- semester examination, quizzes and assignment should not  be  conducted.  However,  all  lectures  and laboratories will be conducted as per schedule. Also, laboratory  end-semester  examination  may  be conducted during this period. 

1. **Scheduling  of  Examinations:**  Mid-semester  and end-semester  examinations  timetable  will  be prepared  by  the  Office  of  Academic  Affairs  and circulated to  all faculty members  and students at least 10 days prior to the start of the examination. 

   The  schedule  for  examination  of  core  and  pre- major courses must be strictly followed. Also, all examinations  (core,  pre-major  and  professional courses)  must  be  conducted  only  during  the approved examination period. 

The scheduling of examination of courses offered through  the  NKN  will  be  decided  by  the  host Institution and the students will be informed by the Office of Academic Affairs/local instructor as soon as the information is received.  

**24| 

2. **Make-up  Examinations**:  If  a  student  misses  the end-semester examination due to genuine reasons, in  one  or  more  course(s),  he/she  can  make  a request,  personally  or  by  nominating  a  suitable person, to the Instructor under intimation to DoAA for a make-up examination within a day of missing the scheduled examination. Such a request must be made  in  writing  and  submitted  to  the  concerned instructor with a copy to the Office of Academic Affairs. If a student is medically unfit, he/she must substantiate it with a certificate from the authorised doctor at the Health Center of the Institute. 

   Only  one  make-up  examination  in  lieu  of  end- semester examination is allowed per course. In case of missing a mid-semester examination, it is totally up  to  the  instructor  as  to  how  he/she  decides  to evaluate the student provided that he/she is satisfied with  the  reasons  given  by  the  student.  The instructor  can  conduct  a  make-up  mid-semester examination or can choose to prorate the student’s performance  based  on  quizzes/assignments/end- semester examination. 

3. **Duration  of  Examinations:**  The  duration  of  the mid-semester  examination  will  be  1½  to  2  hours and the end-semester examination  will be 2 to 3 hours. 
3. **Misconduct during Examination**

3. **Evaluation/Assessment<a name="_page30_x48.00_y447.00"></a>** 

   The assessment of students in a course is a continuous process. It is based on their performance in the mid- semester  examination,  end-semester  examination, quizzes,  assignments,  attendance,  and  make  up examination (if any). 

**27| 

**Weightage for various evaluation components** 

1. For  the  written  component,  the  weightage  is  as follows:  



|**Course Type** |<p>**Minimum weightage** </p><p>**for written** </p><p>**components**</p><p>![](Aspose.Words.064a181a-3d27-423b-8988-873ea0059200.006.png)</p><p>**End** </p><p>**Mid** </p><p>**r Semester**</p><p>**Semeste**</p>|<p>**gnments/** </p><p>**etc.)**</p><p>**term paper/seminar Maximum wefor oigthtaher gce (oqumpizzeonents s/assi**</p>||
| :-: | - | - | :- |
|Core  |30% |50% |20% |
|Professional |20% |30% |30% |

For  professional  courses,  no  more  than  10% weightage  will  be  given  to  oral  examination  and attendance. 

The  weightage  for  various  components  and  the grading policy (absolute or relative) will be made clear  to  the  students  at  the  beginning  of  the semester. 

2. If laboratory work is a part of the course, it will be weighted appropriately depending on total credits for the course. For example, in a given course of four credits, if the credits for theory and laboratory parts in the course are in the ratio of 3:1, the final grades for the course will be assigned such that the weightage  for  the  theory  and  the  laboratory  part remains 3:1. 
2. Instructor  must  retain  the  answer  sheets  for  a minimum of one year before destroying them.  

**28| 

4. **Grading<a name="_page32_x48.00_y40.00"></a>** 
1) **Submission  of  Grades**:  Prior  to  assigning  a  final letter grade, the instructor-in-charge of each course must  show  the  answer  sheets  to  the  students.  The letter grades given by the instructors must reflect the progress of the student based on his/her performance in  the  mid-semester  examination,  end-semester examination,  quizzes,  assignments  and  regular attendance in the classes.**  

   Final  grades  must  be  entered  online  and  a  signed hardcopy  must  be  submitted  to  the  Office  of Academic Affairs within the prescribed time limit as given below:  



|**Number of students** |**Prescribed time-limit** |
| - | - |
|Less than 25 |48 hours |
|26 to 50 |72 hours |
|51 to 150 |96 hours |
|151 to 200 |120 hours |
|More than 200 |144 hours |

2) **Grades:** There are six letter grades: O, A, B, C, D and F. The letter grades, their descriptions, and their numerical equivalents on a scale of 10-points (called grade point) are as follows: 



|**Grade** |**Weight  (grade point)** |**Description** |
| - | :- | - |
|O |10 |Outstanding |
|A |10 |Excellent |
|B |8 |Good |
|C |6 |Fair |
|D |4 |Pass |
|F |0 |Fail |

**29| 

‘O’  grade  is  intended  to  recognize  and  encourage outstanding performance in a class. This grade is to be used sparingly. 

In  addition,  there  is  an  ‘I’  grade  which  stands  for Incomplete. Besides, these grades, there are two other grades ‘S’ and ‘X’. ‘S’ stands for Satisfactory and ‘X’ for Unsatisfactory. 

3) **Incomplete Grade**: An ‘I’ (Incomplete) grade in any course may be awarded to a student who has missed the  end-semester  examination  because  of  some genuine reason, but otherwise has completed all other requirements satisfactorily. An ‘I’ grade in a course should not be given to a student because he/she has failed in it. An ‘I’ grade must, however, be converted into a proper letter grade by the instructor-in-charge and  should  be  communicated  to  the  Office  of Academic Affairs by the last date for submission of grades for make-up examination, as specified in the academic  calendar.  If  the  instructor-in-charge  does not intimate the Office of Academic Affairs on time, all  the  ‘I’  grades  awarded  will  be  automatically converted to ‘F’. 
3) **Satisfactory  and  Unsatisfactory  Grades**:  Grades ‘S’ and ‘X’ do not carry any numerical weight, and are not used for the computation of SPI/CPI. Grade ‘S’  implies  that the student  has  earned the credits. Grade ‘X’ implies that the student has failed in the course and thereby does not earn any credit. 
3) **MS  Thesis  Grade**:  The  fifth  year  of  BS-MS Programme is mostly devoted to MS Thesis. Some departments can have courses along with the thesis work during this period. Each student will be allotted 

**30| 

a faculty  member to  supervise his/her thesis  work. Additionally, for faculty members on probation, a co- supervisor  must  also  be  allotted.  If  the  thesis supervisor  is  away,  a  co-supervisor/administrative supervisor  may  be  assigned  to  the  student.  The progress of the thesis work will be evaluated on the basis of (a) thesis work carried out by the student, (b) a presentation of the thesis work by the student to the entire  Department.  The  first  component  will  be evaluated  by  a  three-member  committee  (proposed by the thesis supervisor of the student) and approved by the DUGC, in each semester. This committee will award marks out of 70. A three-member committee appointed by the Head of the Department will assess the second component and marks will be awarded out of  30.  The  assessment  is  based  on  the  thesis,  oral presentations during the semesters and defense of the work done in the thesis. A letter grade (O-F) will be assigned  based  on  the  total  marks  obtained  in components (a) and (b). 

MS  Thesis  grades  shall  be  given  by  the  last  date specified  for  submission  of  the  grades  in  each  of Semester 9 and 10. An ‘I’ grade shall not be awarded for non-completion of the thesis except due to illness. An ‘I’ grade cannot be awarded for non-completion of the thesis due to lack of facilities.  

**Ph.D.  thesis  work  grades**:  A  student  earns  four credits  for  each  Ph.D.  thesis  unit  he/she  has registered.  Thesis  supervisor  will  monitor  the progress towards thesis credits during every semester and assign the student a letter grade of ‘S’ or ‘X’. For e.g. a student registered for 16 research credits in a semester may be awarded any one of the following 

**31| 

grade combinations: SSSS, SSSX, SSXX, SXXX or XXXX. If a student is on leave for part of a semester or  submits  his/her  thesis  in  the  middle  of  the semester,  the  DoAA  may  reduce  his/her  research credits. 

6) **Change of Grade already awarded**: A letter grade once awarded shall not be changed, unless a request is  made  by  the  course  instructor-in-charge  and  is approved by the Chairperson Senate. Any request for change of grade must be made within six weeks of the start  of the next  semester with  all the relevant records and justifications. 
6) **Semester Performance Index (SPI):** The Semester Performance Index (SPI) is a weighted average of the grade  points  earned  by  a  student  in  all  courses credited and describes his/her academic performance in a semester. SPI is calculated as follows: 

SPI = ∑ =1

- =1

where ci = credit for the ith course; gi= grade point secured  by  the  student.  Summation  is  over  all  ‘n’ courses credited by the student in that semester.  

**(viii) Cumulative  Performance  Index  (CPI)**:  The 

Cumulative  Performance  Index  (CPI)  indicates  the overall  academic  performance  of  a  student  in  all courses  registered  up  to  and  including  the  latest completed semester. CPI is calculated as follows: 

CPI = ∑ =1

- =1

Summation is over all the ‘n’ courses credited by the student in all the completed semesters. Whenever a 

**32| 

student is permitted to appear for re-examination in a course,  then  the  new  letter  grade  replaces  the  old letter grade in the computation of CPI. 

9) **Grade  Report**:  The  grade  report,  with  details  of courses registered and grades obtained, SPI for each semester  and  the  CPI  based  on  the  grades  of  all courses taken up to and including the semester, will be available to the student on Shiksha portal once the result for that semester are declared officially. At the end of the programme a transcript will be provided.  
9) **Withholding of Grades:** The grades of a student can be withheld if he/she has not paid the dues or if there is a case of indiscipline pending against him/her or for any other reason. 
5. **Re-examination<a name="_page36_x48.00_y271.00"></a>** 

   Re-examination  will  be  conducted  for  all  courses  in which students have earned an ‘F’ grade. A new code ‘RE’ will be introduced in the grade report to indicate that the student has appeared for a re-examination. For the purpose of CPI calculation, re-examination will be treated similar to repeating a course.  

1. **Re-examination schedule**  

Re-examination registration window will open for ten days starting from the first working day of June every year. 

Re-examination will be scheduled during the first week of July 

Students will not be allowed to register for more than 6 courses during the re-examination. 

Such  students  will  have  to  pay  the  prescribed examination  fee.  The  student  should  pay  the  fee ![ref2]

**33|** P a g e** 

online and submit online fee receipt along with re- examination  form  to  the  Office  of  Academic Affairs. 

2. **Grading policy**
