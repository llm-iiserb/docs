## Academic Programmes 

**Bachelor of Science (BS)** 

The Four year BS Programme is offered for bright and motivated students who have passed their 10+2 with Mathematics as one of the subjects or equivalent level exam in last two years. 

BS programme consists of core courses in basic sciences and introductory courses in Economics/Engineering during the first year. A subset of all courses on offer which will enable a student to qualify for a choice of ‘Major’ (called pre-major courses) should be taken during the second year. The next two years are dedicated to specialization in the Major disciplines offered by their respective stream. 

After spending four years in BS programme in Economic/Engineering Sciences, students have the option to obtain BS-MS (Dual Degree) in relevant Major by spending an additional year devoted to courses and research project. 

BS in Engineering Sciences is offered in the following departments: 

  Chemical Engineering  Electrical Engineering and Computer Science  Data Science and Engineering 

**Bachelor of Science – Master of Science [BS-MS (Dual Degree)]** 

The Five-year BS-MS (Dual Degree) Programme is offered, to students who have passed their 10+2 or equivalent level exam in last two years, in the following departments of the Natural Sciences Stream: 

  Biological Sciences  Chemistry 


  Earth and Environmental Sciences  Mathematics  Physics 

BS-MS (Dual Degree) programme consists of mandatory, common courses (core courses) for all disciplines during the I and II semester (1st^ year), a subset of all courses on offer which will enable a student to qualify for a choice of ‘Major’ (called pre-major courses) during the III and IV semesters (2nd^ year) and departmental courses (professional courses) during the remaining six semesters (3rd^ year onwards). 

The first year of BS-MS (Dual Degree) programme consists of mandatory, common courses (core courses) from Natural and Engineering Sciences as well as interdisciplinary courses from Humanities, Social Sciences and Economic Sciences. 

During the Pre-major year (Second year) students from Natural Sciences will have to mandatorily register for courses from three disciplines within their stream for a total of 20/21 credits per semester. Departments under Natural Sciences will offer mandatory courses of 6/7 credits per semester and will not impose any mandatory course(s) from other department. The maximum number of students permitted for pre-major in a department is 150. The allotment of pre-major discipline will be on the basis of CPI at the end of first year subject to fulfilling the eligibility criteria. 

Third year onwards, students register for professional courses consisting of discipline dependent mandatory and elective courses for 18-22 credits per semester. During the final year, students are required to register for MS thesis with a faculty supervisor, relevant to their major discipline. 


#### 1. ADMISSION TO BS/BS-MS (DUAL DEGREE) 

#### PROGRAMMES 

 Admission to the BS/BS-MS (Dual Degree) programme is managed by the duly constituted Joint Admissions Committee (JAC) of the IISERs. Admission takes place once a year in July, through the following channels: 

1. Kishore Vaigyanik Protsahan Yojana (KVPY) 

2. IIT-Joint Entrance Examination (Advanced) 

3. State and Central Boards Channel (SCB) Candidates who have passed 10+2 or equivalent level exam with science stream in last two years are eligible to apply for admissions subject to fulfilling the prescribed criteria. Indian nationals and students belonging to PIO or OCI category are eligible to apply. The list of above channels can be modified by the empowered body from time-to-time. Details of admission procedure may be accessed via the IISER Admission website (http://www.iiseradmission.in/) 

#### 2. FACULTY ADVISOR 

 On joining the Institute, every student is assigned to a Faculty Adviser (FA) for the first two year of the programme. The role of FA is of immense importance to students. The Faculty Advisers mainly  advise the students about the rules and regulations governing the programme  give suggestions on the courses to be taken in various semesters 


  Pay special attention to academically weak students The students are expected to meet their FA at least once in a month and discuss any issues related to their progress. The parents/guardians can contact the FA for various academic issues of their wards. 

#### 3. CHANGE OF STREAM 

 The departments of IISER Bhopal are organised under three different streams: (1) Natural Science Stream (2) Engineering Science Stream and (3) Humanities and Social Sciences Stream.  Natural Sciences Stream  Biological Sciences  Chemistry  Earth and Environmental Sciences  Mathematics  Physics  Engineering Sciences Stream  Chemical Engineering  Data Science and Engineering  Electrical Engineering & Computer Science  Humanities and Social Sciences Stream  Economic Sciences  Humanities and Social Sciences Inter stream migration will be permitted only once at the end of first year of the studies. A maximum of 10% of seats sanctioned for each stream will be permitted to opt out of the stream and join other stream, subject to availability of vacant seat in the new stream. The CPI 


 at the end of the first year will be the deciding factor for migration. For change of stream, the students should not have ‘F’ grade in the any course of regular semesters of 1st^ year. Re-examination results will not be considered for migration. For migrating to Economic Sciences and Engineering Sciences, mathematics is mandatory at 10+2. If migration is permitted, the student must register and clear all pending laboratory courses which will be conducted in summers following the first year of study. Students will be charged @ Rs. 5000/per laboratory course. Any theory course of the new stream that has been missed out must be cleared any time before the graduation, pending which degree will not be awarded. 

#### 4. ACADEMIC REQUIREMENTS 

**4.1 Registration in next higher academic year** 

 A student will not be permitted to register for the next higher academic year, if any of the below mentioned clause is satisfied: (i) He/she has a backlog of more than 9 credits at the end of the previous year. Credits of courses with S/X grade will be exempted to register for higher class. However, he/she should earn an ‘S’ grade in that course before the completion of the programme. (ii) He/she has a CPI <5.0. The minimum CPI clause may be relaxed for students who have passed in all the courses. 


 The student will have to drop a year to clear the backlog courses and acquire the CPI stipulated for registration of higher academic year. Termination Any student whose CPI is less than 3 any time after the end of 1st^ year will be terminated from the programme. Further, a student may also be terminated from his/her programme due to misconduct or other reasons as recommended by the Senate. 

**4.2 Year Drop and Provisions for a student on year drop**  A maximum of 2 year drops is permitted during the entire course of study.  He/she should register for all courses with F grades (as far as possible), if offered, during the year drop.  He/she may register for less than the minimum specific load of 12 credits per semester.  He/she will be permitted to register for up to a maximum of 20 credits per semester for grade improvement.  He/she will not be permitted to register for more than 21 credits in all during a semester.  He/she will not be permitted to register for higherlevel courses during the year drop.

 A maximum of one overload course will be permitted to students with a CPI ≥ 8.0 and a maximum of two overload courses will be permitted to students with CPI ≥ 9.0. 

**4.4 Repeat/Substitute/Improvement** 

 Over and above the minimum compulsory credit requirement, a maximum of two courses will be permitted per semester under the category of repeat/substitute/improvement/overload courses. 

**4.5 Registration for Higher Level Courses** 

 During the V and VI semesters (the first year into the ‘Major’), students will not be permitted to register for courses at a level higher than ‘300’. Students in semesters VII to X (4th^ and 5th^ year) will be permitted to register for higher-level courses, upon fulfilling the pre-requisites. 

#### 5. SELECTION OF MAJOR DISCIPLINE 

**5.1 Major Discipline** 

 A student will choose his/her ‘Major’ discipline in the respective stream by the end of the IV semester (2nd year) and will register for the same at the start of the V semester (3rd^ year). However, in addition to the students admitted into the Engineering Science stream the students admitted in Natural Sciences and Economic Sciences stream are allowed to take the Data Science & Engineering premajor courses in their 2nd^ year. These students, who have completed the Data Science & Engineering premajor courses, are allowed to migrate to BS 


 programme in Engineering Sciences stream majoring in the department of Data Science & Engineering. The maximum number of students permitted to major in a department is 50. The allotment of major discipline will be on the basis of CPI subject to fulfilling the eligibility criteria. The student may be allotted second or third choice based on the seats available and CPI scored. 

**5.2 Change of ‘Major’ Discipline** 

 A student can change his/her ‘Major’ before the start of the VII semester (4th^ year) with prior approval of the Head of the Department to which the student wishes to migrate subject to availability of the seats, under intimation to the Head of the current ‘Major’ discipline. The CPI at the end of the third year will be the deciding factor for the Major Change. Also, migrations will be permitted only at the start of odd semesters. If a student chooses to change his/her ‘Major’, he/she should do so within the add/drop deadline. Departments may recommend imposing a year drop to ensure that a student changing his/her ‘Major’ fulfils curriculum requirements. The successful completion of all courses and other requirements, as laid down by the Department in which the student wants to ‘Major’, is mandatory for award of degree with that ‘Major’. 

#### 6. REQUIREMENT FOR EARNING A ‘MINOR’

 There is also a provision in the Institute to earn a ‘Minor’ in a discipline(s) other than the one in which she/he earns a ‘Major’. Earning a ‘Minor’ will enable students to be better prepared for inter-disciplinary research and will potentially open up several career opportunities, which may not have been otherwise accessible. Minoring in more than one discipline is permitted subject to meeting the required criteria. Starting from Y18 Batch, to earn a ‘Minor’, the student has to acquire a minimum of 18 credits in the discipline in which he/she wants to ‘Minor’. Departments may further impose additional requirements to ‘Minor’ in their disciplines (for example, crediting certain courses from their discipline) after due approval of the Senate. The student may seek permission from the DUGC/DoAA for any additional course-load (academic overload) required to meet these criteria. The student must claim for award of ‘Minor’ discipline in the prescribed format, following which, the grade report of the student, in addition to the ‘Major’ discipline will also show the ‘Minor’ discipline(s), if earned.
