# How to lodge a complaint (Women Cell)

You can talk to/write to/email/telephone any member of the complaint cell
Alternatively send an email to womencell@iiserb.ac.in, ICC@iiserb.ac.in

The name of the complainant is kept confidential. In addition, the complaint cell would like to put forward the following strategy to IISER Bhopal community in order to avoid any untoward incidences

All the research labs/UG labs/offices should have clearly displayed emergency contact numbers and a designated officer(s) available round the clock to be contacted in an emergency.
The workplace should be well lit till the last occupant leaves the place.
The entire see through panels (in door, windows etc.) in research labs/UG labs/offices should not be obstructed and should permit a clear view

To work without harassment is our fundamental right.

# Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) at IISER Bhopal

An Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) has been set up at IISER Bhopal as per provisions of Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition, Redressal) Act 2013, with the following aims:

- To ensure that no female employees (including permanent, temporary, and contractual employees) or female students are subjected to gender specific discrimination or sexual harassment.
- To provide a platform for all individuals to register a complaint if they are subjected to any act of sexual harassment at IISER Bhopal.
- To investigate and recommend action against any individual found guilty of harassing another individual of any gender.
- To facilitate a gender-sensitive and congenial working environment at IISER Bhopal so that individuals can work in an atmosphere free of gender specific discrimination.

# What is Sexual Harassment?

The Supreme Court guidelines define sexual harassment to include:

- Physical contact and advances
- Demand or request for sexual favors
- Sexually colored remarks
- Display of pornography
- Any other unwelcome physical, verbal or non-verbal conduct of a sexual nature (including voyeurism and stalking)

Often such behavior goes unpunished because of hesitation on the part of victim to report such behavior out of a sense of shame or fear or both.
It is important to protest against any behavior that you find uncomfortable, harassing, unwanted, and unacceptable.

The Institute strongly condemns such behavior and advices all its members not to indulge in any such activity.
